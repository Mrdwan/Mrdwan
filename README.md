- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mohamed Radwan

With 10+ years of experience in the field, I have a deep understanding of PHP and Javascript.

I possess expertise in web services, including REST and SOAP, and am proficient in various web development frameworks such as WordPress, PHP, Laravel, and CodeIgniter. 
Additionally, I am highly skilled in Javascript, jQuery, Vue.js, React.js, AngularJs, and Node.

Frontend Development:
âœ… HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery
âœ… Vue.js, Tailwind.css

Backend Development:

âœ… AWS Infrastructure, DevOps, AWS Architect, AWS Services (EC2, ECS, Fargate, S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, RDS, Elastic Beanstalk, AWS CDK, AWS CodeDeploy etc.), Serverless application development.

I work at US timezones, and am easy to communicate with on Slack, Zoom, or any other remote collaboration platform. Clear communication is critical to effective software development, and I speak and write excellent English.

I work well in teams, and can stay in my lane for specific features or collaborate with product teams to help shape entire products as needed.

If you are considering hiring me, let's set up a short call to see if there's a match. I'm happy to share code examples from past projects (I've obtained approval for this), or even engage in a short initial project to see if we can work effectively together.
